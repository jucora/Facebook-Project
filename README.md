# Facebook Clone

In this project, we built a Facebook-like application. We did not focus on styling, but instead, we focused on the core functionalities: users, friends, posts, and likes. We also implemented a "sign-in with Facebook" functionality with Omniauth. We also wrote some basic set of unit and integration tests to make sure the associations and the principal visual elements were properly made.

## Technologies

- Ruby on Rails
- PostgreSQL
- Bootstrap
- Omniauth
- RSpec/Capybara
